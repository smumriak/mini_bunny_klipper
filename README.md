# Klipper configuration for Prusa Mini Bunny

Prusa Mini Bunny is my heavily modified 3D printer based on Prusa Mini+. This repository contains complete configuration of Klipper for this printer.
Main differences are:
  - [Bondtech  IFS Extruder for Prusa Mini or Mini+](https://www.bondtech.se/product/ifs-extruder-for-prusa-mini/)
  - [E3D Revo Micro Hotend](https://e3d-online.com/products/revo-micro)
  - [Z Axis Rigid Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4881439)
  - [Prusa Mini Silicone Bed Leveling Mod](https://github.com/bbbenji/PMSBLM)
  - Misumi bearings on X and Y axes
  - Remixed X axis end Stop from [Stiffer X-End for Prusa Mini with square nuts](https://www.printables.com/model/246375-stiffer-x-end-for-prusa-mini-with-square-nuts)
  - Remixed SuperPINDA precision adjuster from [SuperPINDA Precision Adjuster for Prusa MINI/MINI+](https://www.printables.com/model/254166-superpinda-precision-adjuster-for-prusa-minimini/files)
  - Small misc things like custom designed drag chains for X, Y and Z axes, higher TPU feet, capricorn bowden tube, pneumatic coupler for bowden tube, etc.
  
  The community of Klipper users on Prusa Mini is extremely small and it's extremely hard to come by a valid working config file for it. Thus I've shared mine for anyone to reference.
